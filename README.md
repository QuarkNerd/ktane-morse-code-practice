# Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes - Morse code practice

I don't know about you, but I struggle with the morse code aspect of KTANE, just reading the light is difficult to me, so I made this to help me out. The durations match the game, you can choose to dislay your own sequences of dots and dashes, (spaces are considred letter gaps). Or you can have random letters appear and try to guess them.

## What it doesn't do

I didn't want to overfit the training to the game nor take away the communication aspect. So the words from the game aren't used (no real words are) and you can't see the normal representation of letters diplayed (this is not a tool to just learn morse code)
